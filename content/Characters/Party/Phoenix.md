**Race**: [[Humans|Human]]  
**Class**: Druid  
**Companion**: A loyal dog 
**Appearance**:  Phoenix carries a rugged calm — a face carved by the wind and softened by silence. His dark eyes are intense, thoughtful, yet distant, as if always listening to something just beyond the veil of the world. There’s a depth to his gaze, the kind that suggests he has endured much — and speaks little of it.
