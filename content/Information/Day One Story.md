I woke up alone, with no memory of what had happened before. Around me, no one seemed to recall anything either.

I am a Bard Astrologist, my dark blonde hair falls near shoulder length, and I am already trying to piece together the memories I have left.

Nearby stood a small gnome cleric, though I couldn't tell which deity she served. There was something odd about her as if masking some secret. She carried a peculiar mace doused in glitter, 

A druid was with us too, accompanied by his loyal dog. His face carried a quiet intensity, with deep-set eyes and a calm resolve, like someone who’s seen much yet speaks little.

Lastly, a blonde crossbowman, kind of secretive of his abilities completed our strange group.

As we gathered our senses, a feminine voice echoed in our minds. It urged us to seek out **Starkweather’s Sword**. The name sparked a distant memory of a hero who had once fallen fighting the drow. Starkweather John had slain the Drow Zomelach before dying of his poison.

I felt drawn toward the village of **Bronce**, which I recalled was nearby. The voice whispered again, “The villagers are ours,” hinting that they might be allies.

The others hesitated to rush to Bronce. Instead, they wanted to explore the small island we found ourselves on.

Here, towering stones rose, etched with images of constellations — a sight that deeply fascinated me. We all bore markings of these constellations, as if chosen or cursed by the stars themselves. On my forehead rested the **Eye of the Watchman** — a celestial mark that hums with quiet power.

While the others explored the small island, Phoenix—the druid—came face to face with a pack of **Shadow Goblins**. Hearing his call, we rushed to his aid. The fight was fierce but brief, and together we overcame the threat.

After the battle, Rey, the blonde crossbowman, carefully examined the ancient stones on the island. He took notes on the inscriptions carved into their surfaces, likely tied to the constellations that marked us all.

With the immediate danger behind us and knowledge in hand, we set off toward the nearby village of **Bronce**.

Upon arrival, a friendly guard welcomed us and shared valuable information about the area:

- **Jim the Bully**: Owner of the local windmill and troublemaker to watch out for.
    
- **Mayor Goodchild**: The village leader.
    
- **Father Tobias Bronson**: The local cleric, known to be a trustworthy source who might shed light on our strange circumstances.
    

We spent some time in the village inn, the **Golden Orb**, accompanied by the guard, gathering our thoughts and planning our next move.

Deciding it was time to seek guidance, we met with Father Tobias. He was kind and informative, telling us the location of **Starkweather John’s grave**.

With this new lead, we prepared ourselves and set out toward the grave, hoping to uncover more about the hero and the strange fate that seems to bind us all.

On the grave was the inscription 
> ### Gravestone Inscription  
> *Stranger, trouble not the bones*  
> *Resting here beneath these stones*  
> *Here lies one of mortal part*  
> *Who held a star within his heart*  
> *And when They come that came before*  
> *The Stars shall fall to earth once more*  
> *To stand against Her might again*  
> *Who rises from Her sleep profane*  
> *And when conspirators assail*  
> *The throne, then these may yet avail*  
> *To cast from his exalted place*  
> *The foe that bears a dead king’s face*

We came across a black-fletched [[Drow]] arrow with tracks splitting in two directions — one set veering into the forest, the other toward the mine. After a brief discussion, we agreed to investigate the forest first.

Winding through the woods, we eventually discovered a [[Hobgoblin Camp]]. About six adult hobgoblins, along with their children, were gathered around modest tents and a low-burning fire. They weren’t hostile — just wary. After observing them from a safe distance, we chose not to engage. There was no need for bloodshed.

We turned our attention back to the second trail, following it to the mine. It didn’t take long to notice signs of recent use — discarded bottles, disturbed dirt, and a faint reek of alcohol. Someone — likely a drunk — had been coming and going.

Despite concerns that the tunnels might flood, we pressed inside. Before long, we stumbled upon the source of the smell: a drunken hobgoblin slumped against a crate. He wasn’t in the mood for negotiation. A short fight followed, and we left him unconscious on the stone floor.

Then, deeper into the mine, we encountered a wall of thick, pale spiderwebs. For reasons unclear, [[Rey]] told [[Phoenix]] to burn them. And — reluctantly — he did.

To his regret.

The webs hissed as they burned... and then moved. Countless tiny legs poured out from the shadows, the fire waking not silence, but a storm of spiders crawling toward him.

After all, we managed to **escape the spiders**, and I felt the need to complain about provoking our luck. When the danger passed, we were worried that we might have caused the death of an unconscious [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblin]], so we went inside to check. **He was alive!** We moved him outside the mine and followed the rails.

As we were following down the path, we **heard whispers**. We decided to check it out. We got **attacked by hobgoblins**! They were scared and unwilling to discuss the motive of their assault, so we fought them off. As we moved back to the rails, we **saw a ghost**. The ghost simply pointed downwards and let us be.

We found a way to get to the **lower level of the mine**. There was a platform that could be lowered. We tied a rope to make sure we had a way up. We moved down and saw the **flooded mine**—it would be tough to get through.

We were about to leave when we saw a **dead body**, cut through with an axe. It was the **ghost's body**—this is what he wanted us to find. The body belonged to a [[Tax Collector|tax collector]], and we would soon find out who killed him.

However, against our better judgement, we decided to move through the flooded mine. It was where **J + C** were—[[Jed and Callum|Jed]] and [[Jed and Callum|Callum]]. They were being held hostage by some hobgoblins. We learned that **Jed, the boy, had escaped into the mine**. We **offered 2,000 gold** for both of them—not that we had that kind of gold! It was a **deception** to make sure the boy was safe and to give both children some time to live as we planned how to save them.

We left for now, and as we tried to get back up, we realized something—**no one was on the upper level to raise the platform**. The rope came in handy after all. We climbed up and moved to the exit.

There, **[[Jim Oakenbough]] was waiting for us**, and we got the answer to the question: _"Who killed the tax collector?"_ He attacked us, and we were **forced to kill him and his team**. Only one escaped—running toward the [[Windmill]].

I really did not want to follow them there. It would **get us into bigger trouble**. Our only chance would be to go back to [[Bronce]] and hope they would not all turn against us.
