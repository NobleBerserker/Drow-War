I woke up alone, with no memory of what had happened before. Around me, no one seemed to recall anything either.

I am a Bard Astrologist, my dark blonde hair falls near shoulder length, and I am already trying to piece together the memories I have left.

Nearby stood a small gnome cleric, though I couldn't tell which deity she served. There was something odd about her as if masking some secret. She carried a peculiar mace doused in glitter, 

A druid was with us too, accompanied by his loyal dog. His face carried a quiet intensity, with deep-set eyes and a calm resolve, like someone who’s seen much yet speaks little.

Lastly, a blonde crossbowman, kind of secretive of his abilities completed our strange group.

As we gathered our senses, a feminine voice echoed in our minds. It urged us to seek out **Starkweather’s Sword**. The name sparked a distant memory of a hero who had once fallen fighting the drow. Starkweather John had slain the Drow Zomelach before dying of his poison.

I felt drawn toward the village of **Bronce**, which I recalled was nearby. The voice whispered again, “The villagers are ours,” hinting that they might be allies.

The others hesitated to rush to Bronce. Instead, they wanted to explore the small island we found ourselves on.

Here, towering stones rose, etched with images of constellations — a sight that deeply fascinated me. We all bore markings of these constellations, as if chosen or cursed by the stars themselves. On my forehead rested the **Eye of the Watchman** — a celestial mark that hums with quiet power.

While the others explored the small island, Phoenix—the druid—came face to face with a pack of **Shadow Goblins**. Hearing his call, we rushed to his aid. The fight was fierce but brief, and together we overcame the threat.

After the battle, Rey, the blonde crossbowman, carefully examined the ancient stones on the island. He took notes on the inscriptions carved into their surfaces, likely tied to the constellations that marked us all.

With the immediate danger behind us and knowledge in hand, we set off toward the nearby village of **Bronce**.

Upon arrival, a friendly guard welcomed us and shared valuable information about the area:

- **Jim the Bully**: Owner of the local windmill and troublemaker to watch out for.
    
- **Mayor Goodchild**: The village leader.
    
- **Father Tobias Bronson**: The local cleric, known to be a trustworthy source who might shed light on our strange circumstances.
    

We spent some time in the village inn, the **Golden Orb**, accompanied by the guard, gathering our thoughts and planning our next move.

Deciding it was time to seek guidance, we met with Father Tobias. He was kind and informative, telling us the location of **Starkweather John’s grave**.

With this new lead, we prepared ourselves and set out toward the grave, hoping to uncover more about the hero and the strange fate that seems to bind us all.

On the grave was the inscription 
> ### Gravestone Inscription  
> *Stranger, trouble not the bones*  
> *Resting here beneath these stones*  
> *Here lies one of mortal part*  
> *Who held a star within his heart*  
> *And when They come that came before*  
> *The Stars shall fall to earth once more*  
> *To stand against Her might again*  
> *Who rises from Her sleep profane*  
> *And when conspirators assail*  
> *The throne, then these may yet avail*  
> *To cast from his exalted place*  
> *The foe that bears a dead king’s face*

We came across a black-fletched [[Drow]] arrow with tracks splitting in two directions — one set veering into the forest, the other toward the mine. After a brief discussion, we agreed to investigate the forest first.

Winding through the woods, we eventually discovered a [[Hobgoblin Camp]]. About six adult hobgoblins, along with their children, were gathered around modest tents and a low-burning fire. They weren’t hostile — just wary. After observing them from a safe distance, we chose not to engage. There was no need for bloodshed.

We turned our attention back to the second trail, following it to the mine. It didn’t take long to notice signs of recent use — discarded bottles, disturbed dirt, and a faint reek of alcohol. Someone — likely a drunk — had been coming and going.

Despite concerns that the tunnels might flood, we pressed inside. Before long, we stumbled upon the source of the smell: a drunken hobgoblin slumped against a crate. He wasn’t in the mood for negotiation. A short fight followed, and we left him unconscious on the stone floor.

Then, deeper into the mine, we encountered a wall of thick, pale spiderwebs. For reasons unclear, [[Rey]] told [[Phoenix]] to burn them. And — reluctantly — he did.

To his regret.

The webs hissed as they burned... and then moved. Countless tiny legs poured out from the shadows, the fire waking not silence, but a storm of spiders crawling toward him.
