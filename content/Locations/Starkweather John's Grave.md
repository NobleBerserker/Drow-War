A Grave by the road, on the grave was the following inscription.
> *Stranger, trouble not the bones*  
> *Resting here beneath these stones*  
> *Here lies one of mortal part*  
> *Who held a star within his heart*  
> *And when They come that came before*  
> *The Stars shall fall to earth once more*  
> *To stand against Her might again*  
> *Who rises from Her sleep profane*  
> *And when conspirators assail*  
> *The throne, then these may yet avail*  
> *To cast from his exalted place*  
> *The foe that bears a dead kingâ€™s face*
